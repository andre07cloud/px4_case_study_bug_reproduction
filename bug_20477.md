## bug #20477
| GitHub bug link |  https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/20477   |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Code Release         | v1.13.0                                 |
| Os version           | Ubuntu 20.04                                      |
| Vehicle model        | Standard VTOL                                             |
| Simulator type       | Gazebo SITL                                       |
| Bug Description      | The drone sometimes loiters around a wrong position and doesn't respect NAV_LOITER_RAD nor the desired turning direction.I've observed it regularly on SITL VTOLs, and I could also break it once on a SITL plane. On VTOLs it's always the first HOLD command after a transition in mission mode which fucks up. The drone either holds around Home or at next Waypoint, but not at current position as it's supposed to. Resuming mission and then triggering Hold again works fine. Even the Hold in MC mode is affected by this, if triggered after a back transition. On a pure FW drone I don't know what it takes to break, but it's possible as well. I've had one occurrence where the drone flew to the next WP instead of Loitering at current position. Also, if this happens, then the NAV_LOITER_RAD is ignored and the drone is just flying with max bank angle. The bug is present in both v1.13 and current main.                                 |
| Expexted Behavior    | In the QGroungcontroller tool interface, VTOL drone must take the HOLD command and loiter arround the waypoint where HOLD command was done. The drone must orbite at the waypoint where hold command is activated until the user decide to continuous the planned mission.                                 |
| Observed Behavior    | In the QGroungcontroller tool interface, VTOL drone doesn't take the HOLD command at the first time. He continouous his mission normaly without loiter arround the waypoint where HOLD command was done.                                 |
| Output               | Here the output is the behavior of the vehicle observed in QGroungcontroller tool inteface.                                 |
##### Step to Reproduce


1. clone px4 software form github official repository :
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
    ```
2. clean submodules from main branch :
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
    ```bash
    make distclean
    ```
3. checkout to the branch release :
    ```bash
    git checkout v1.13.0
    ```
4. update submodules for the new release :
    ```bash
    make submodulesclean
    ```
5. execute the following commands inside terminal :
    ```bash
    make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol
    ```
    - upload a [file](./Zurich.FT.loiter.bug.zip) mission in the vehicle from QGroundControl.
    - trigger HOLD command in any waypoint from QGroundControl
