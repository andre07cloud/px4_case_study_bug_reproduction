# An exploratory study of bug reproduction in UAVs sytems : PX4 case study


# Replication
## bug #20260
| GitHub bug link |  https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/20260     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Code Release         | v1.13.0 & v1.13.2                                 |
| Os version           | Ubuntu 20.04                                      |
| Vehicle model        | Plane                                             |
| Simulator type       | Gazebo SITL                                       |
| Bug Description      | When running takeoff in SITL without QGC running, the plane immediately goes into failsafe, goes into RTL and then crases                                 |
| Expexted Behavior    | When takeoff command is done in gazebo simulator, the plane must takeoff normaly.                                 |
| Observed Behavior    | The first time that takeoff command is done, the plane drone tries to takeoff, but fails after a little distance on the ground.                                 |
| Output               | Here the output is the behavior of the vehicle observed in the gazebo inteface.                                 |
##### Step to Reproduce


1. clone px4 software form github official repository :
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
    ```
2. clean submodules from main branch :
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
    ```bash
    make distclean
    ```
3. checkout to the branch release :
    ```bash
    git checkout v1.13.2
    ```
4. update submodules for the new release :
    ```bash
    make submodulesclean
    ```
5. execute the following commands inside terminal :
    ```bash
    make px4_sitl gazebo_plane
    ```
    hit Enter and run :
    ```bash
    commander takeoff
    ```
