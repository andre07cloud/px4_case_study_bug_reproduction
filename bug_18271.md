## bug #20260
| GitHub bug link |  https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/20260     |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Code Release         | v1.12.3                                 |
| Os version           | Ubuntu 20.04                                      |
| Vehicle model        | Standard VTOL                                     |
| Simulator type       | Gazebo SITL                                       |
| Bug Description      | With RTL_TYPE = 3 and RTL_TYPE = 1 the drone always flies to mission landing to land even if it's by far not the closest point. To be precise, it first flies to the correct RTL position but then instead of descending to RTL_DESCEND_ALT it flies to mission landing to land there...More technically: The phase corresponding to "RTL: return at 548 m (60 m above destination)" is correct. But as soon as it goes into "RTL: descend to 518 m (30 m above destination)" then it flies to the wrong position. To Reproduce Reproducible on SITL on v1.12 and master. Tested with make px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol and the following mission: [bad RTL.zip](./bad.RTL.zip). Trigger RTL when it's closer to home or RP than it is to mission land and observe the bug.                                 |
| Expexted Behavior    | The drone should land at the closest safe point (home, rallypoint) according to the parameter description and not land and mission landing which might be very far away. Log Files and Screenshots v1.12, RTL_TYPE = 3 : https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=98b92060-e3e4-4a81-afcc-16a9dc8315e0; master, RTL_TYPE = 3: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=a5edc70d-8be0-424f-98dc-0c96f8d31c16; master, RTL_TYPE = 1: https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=9f6e48ee-6b5b-4b2c-83df-3a8de754352d. For reference, here is what it should look like: (RTL_TYPE = 0) https://logs.px4.io/plot_app?log=dbb7f55f-6038-41c1-b009-bbd39c177af7 (I don't like the loitering down, but that's another point)                                 |
| Observed Behavior    |                                  |
| Output               | Here the output is the behavior of the vehicle observed in the gazebo inteface.                                 |
##### Step to Reproduce


1. clone px4 software form github official repository :
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
    ```
2. clean submodules from main branch :
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
    ```bash
    make distclean
    ```
3. checkout to the branch release :
    ```bash
    git checkout v1.12.3
    ```
4. update submodules for the new release :
    ```bash
    make submodulesclean
    ```
5. execute the following commands inside terminal :
    ```bash
    px4_sitl gazebo_standard_vtol
    ```
    - upload a mission [file](./bad.RTL.zip) in the vehicle from QGroundControl.
    - trigger RTL command in any waypoint from QGroundControl
